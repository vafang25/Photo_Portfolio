            <p id=about>I am a rising junior at the Trinity School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. This summer, I am participating in the Girls Who Code
            Immersion Program at Morgan Stanley, where we learn programming languages such as Python, Arduino-C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of now, it has been an
            amazing experience and I have made many friendships that I will continue to value after the program. Outside of coding, my favorite pastime is photography.
            I usually photograph with both digital (my color work) and film (my black and white work) cameras. I shoot both portraits and landscapes, but usually prefer
            portraits because it allows me to meet new people and have shared experiences with both friends and strangers. I usually develop and print my film in the 
            darkroom to have a preview of the photo, before it is scanned and processed with Adobe Photoshop.</p>
